# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project 

This project be a portfolio website so that I can showcase my skills and experience to recruiters and potential clients.
The website will be a means to which I can portray my experience, skills to the audience in a pleasant manner.
The website will also be interactive and include designs which can be appreciated by any web user.

## UX

The website will contain a simple design to ensure the primary function of providing information to the audience in included. 
To complement this an interactive, easy on the eye design will be implemented.
This will be executed by designing a single paged long scroll website, with options to navigate to any particular sections using the Menu bar.
Implementing this design will keep the audience engages and compliment the users stories by firstly feeding the user with “what” it is that do, secondly, showing projects to convey “How” I do it and finally, providing a means of contact should they want to collaborate.
