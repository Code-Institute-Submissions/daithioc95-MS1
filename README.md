# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project 

This project is a portfolio website to showcase my skills and experience to recruiters and potential clients.
The website will also be interactive and include designs which can be appreciated by the user.
The website will both a vehicle for my brand and a means of contact for interested parties.

## UX

The website will contain a simple design to ensure the primary function of providing information to the audience included. 
To complement this, an interactive, easy on the eye design will be implemented.
This will be executed by designing a single paged long scroll website, with options to navigate to any particular sections using the Menu bar.
Implementing this design will keep the audience engages and compliment the users stories by firstly feeding the user with “what” it is that do, secondly, showing projects to convey “How” I do it and finally, providing a means of contact should they want to collaborate.

### User Stories
- As a recruiter/potential client, I was to see the web developers experience, so that I can see if this is relevant to the job/project requirements.
- As a recruiter/potential client, I was to see the web developers’ skills, so that I can see if these skills match the job/project.
- As a recruiter/potential client, I was to see the developer’s portfolio, so that I can see if his previous projects require capabilities relevant to this job/project.
- As a recruiter/potential client, I want to easily find this information while appreciating the websites design, so that I can see that the developer is competent in front-end development.
- As a recruiter/potential client, if interested I want to contact to the developer, so that I can see if he is available for work.

###Design Process 
I began the design process by firstly identifying the sections neccessary to meet the criteria of my use stories. This included the Home, About, Experience, Portfolio & Contact sections.
The next stage of the process was to brainstorm features. 
In addition to the usual sections a portfolio website contains, I wanted to use an interactive map as a statement piece to showcase CSS skills and provide information on my international experience.
I decided on this feature for large screens only as using a small screen would be difficule to select specific points on the map.
When searching for potential maps on pxhere.com, I can accross a treasure map like map which cuited the feature aestetically.
Using the lightest and darkest colors from the map, I input this to https://mycolor.space/ to generate a 3 color gradient and thats when I choose a tealish #5FFBF1 color as my primary site color.
Other features I decided on were a progress bar for skills, I took inspiration for thing for the mini-project as it is a great was to visually portray my skills.
When all my sections and additional features were decided upon, I moved onto creating wireframes for both the mobile and browser.
I began this by using pen and paper and once a general, responsive idea formed, I created the below using balsamiq.
